# Future Improvements
# 1. Improve Data Mocking for Tests
Instead of reading data directly from `ITollDataProvider` in the tests, consider mocking the data or finding a more flexible way to inject the necessary data. This will make the tests more isolated, easier to configure, and potentially reduce coupling between components.

## 2. Configurable Toll-Free Months
This means we could use a configuration file or service to set which months are toll-free, making it easier to adapt to changes in policy. * and now july its just hardcoded in test and code 

## 3. API and Endpoint Versioning
All applications grow, weâ€™ll want to introduce versioning for our API endpoints. This will help us manage changes smoothly and ensure that older versions remain functional, allowing users to transition at their own pace.

## 4. Improved Charge Calculation Logic
We May need consider refactoring our charge calculation to be year-specific. This way, we can adjust pricing strategies based on the current year and its associated holidays. By injecting this configuration, we can keep our logic clean and adaptable.

## 5. Create a Schema for API request and response
Defining a clear schema for our API responses would help standardize the data format. 

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline for Testing
To maintain high code quality, we should set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

# 7. Improve Data Mocking for Tests
Instead of reading data directly from `ITollDataProvider` in the tests, consider mocking the data or finding a more flexible way to inject the necessary data. This will make the tests more isolated, easier to configure, and potentially reduce coupling between components.

# 8. Test Improvements
- **Expanding Test Coverage**: Ensuring that all possible scenarios are tested, including edge cases.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Using parameterized tests to reduce code duplication and improve test coverage for various inputs.
- **Mocking Dependencies**: Utilizing mocking frameworks to isolate tests from external dependencies, allowing for more reliable and faster tests.
- **Integration Testing**: Implementing integration tests to validate the complete workflow and interactions between different components of the system.
- **Error Handling Tests**: Creating tests to simulate error scenarios, ensuring that our application handles exceptions gracefully.
